### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for these labels in our issues:

- `good-first-issue` - Simple issues perfect for beginners
- `help-wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

## üíª Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Follow the setup instructions in the [README](README.md)
2. Make sure all tests pass before making changes:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -workspace Interspace.xcworkspace -scheme Interspace
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Write clean, readable code** following our style guidelines
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Run all tests** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Test on multiple devices/simulators** if possible

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Add UI tests for user-facing features
- Test on both iPhone and iPad if applicable
- Test in both light and dark mode

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Swift Style Guide

We follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) with these additions:

```swift
// MARK: - Good Example
class ProfileManager {
    private let userDefaults: UserDefaults
    
    init(userDefaults: UserDefaults = .standard) {
        self.userDefaults = userDefaults
    }
    
    func saveProfile(_ profile: Profile) throws {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// MARK: - Bad Example
class profile_manager {
    var ud: UserDefaults!
    
    func SaveProfile(profile: Profile) {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Key Points

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer `let` over `var` when possible
- Use Swift's type inference where appropriate
- Group related functionality with `// MARK: -` comments
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper access control (`private`, `internal`, `public`)

### SwiftUI Best Practices

- Keep views small and composable
- Use `@StateObject` for view models
- Prefer `@EnvironmentObject` for shared state
- Extract complex views into separate files
- Use preview providers for development

## üìù Commit Guidelines

We use conventional commits for clear communication:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add biometric authentication support

- Implement Face ID/Touch ID authentication
- Add privacy usage description to Info.plist
- Create BiometricAuthManager service

Closes #123
```

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** with:
