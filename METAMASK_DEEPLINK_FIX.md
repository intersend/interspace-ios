# MetaMask Deeplink Fix Summary

## Changes Made to Fix MetaMask SIWE Authentication with SPM

### 1. AppDelegate.swift
- **Early SDK Initialization**: Added MetaMask SDK initialization in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` to ensure it's ready before any deeplink handling
- **Improved URL Handling**: Enhanced the URL handling logic to catch multiple MetaMask callback patterns:
  - Check for `interspace://mmsdk` 
  - Check for URLs containing "metamask" or "mmsdk"
  - More comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. WalletService.swift
- **Simplified Connection Flow**: Changed from `connectAndSign` to sequential `connect` then `sign` approach for better reliability
- **Enhanced SDK Configuration**: 
  - Added app icon URL to metadata
  - Added comprehensive debug logging
  - Clear existing connections before new connection attempts
- **Better Error Handling**: More detailed error messages and logging throughout the connection flow

### 3. Info.plist
- **Additional URL Schemes**: Added `https` to `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` to support MetaMask app link URLs

### 4. Key Technical Details
- Using `Transport.deeplinking(dappScheme: "interspace")` for MetaMask SDK
- The callback URL pattern is `interspace://mmsdk` 
- Sequential connect + sign provides more reliable results than `connectAndSign` with SPM

## Testing Instructions

1. Ensure MetaMask app is installed on the device
2. Try linking a MetaMask account from the profile settings
3. The flow should:
   - Open MetaMask app
   - Show the signature request
   - Return to the app after signing
   - Successfully link the wallet account

## Debug Tips

If issues persist:
1. Check console logs for detailed connection flow
2. Verify INFURA_API_KEY is properly configured in build settings
3. Ensure the device has MetaMask installed (not just simulator)
4. Check that the URL scheme `interspace` is properly registered

## Comparison with CocoaPods

The main differences when using SPM vs CocoaPods:
- SDK initialization timing is more critical with SPM
- URL handling needs to be more comprehensive
- Sequential operations (connect then sign) work better than combined operations
