## 🛠️ Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review Requirements

- Security-focused code review for all PRs
- Automated security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Static code analysis

### Development Guidelines

1. **Never commit secrets**
   - Use environment variables
   - Add to .gitignore
   - Rotate if exposed

2. **Validate all inputs**
   ```swift
   // Good
   guard let email = emailField.text?.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines),
         isValidEmail(email) else {
       throw ValidationError.invalidEmail
   }
   
   // Bad
   let email = emailField.text!
   ```

3. **Use secure APIs**
   - Prefer modern cryptographic APIs
   - Avoid deprecated security functions
   - Use iOS security frameworks

4. **Handle sensitive data carefully**
   ```swift
   // Clear sensitive data
   defer {
       password.removeAll()
       privateKey.removeAll()
   }
   ```

### Security Checklist for PRs

## 📊 Security Audits

We conduct regular security assessments:

- **Quarterly**: Dependency scanning
- **Bi-annually**: Penetration testing
- **Annually**: Full security audit
- **Continuous**: Automated scanning

Audit reports available upon request for partners.

## 🔍 Security Headers

Our API implements these security headers:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## 📱 iOS-Specific Security

### App Transport Security
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
```

### Keychain Access
```swift
// Secure storage example
let keychain = KeychainManager()
try keychain.store(password, for: "user_password")
```

### Biometric Authentication
```swift
// Biometric protection
let context = LAContext()
context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics,
                      localizedReason: "Authenticate to access your wallet")
```
