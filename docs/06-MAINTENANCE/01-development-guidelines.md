- Keep ViewModels close to their Views
- Services should be in the Services directory
- Use dependency injection for testability

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from main
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Run tests before pushing

### Testing Requirements

- Test ViewModels thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies
- Maintain >70% code coverage

### Documentation
